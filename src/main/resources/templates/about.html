					<p class="text-start">A contact manager is a software program that enables users to easily store and find contact
						information, such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers. They are contact-centric databases that provide a fully
						integrated approach to tracking all information and communication activities linked to contacts.
						Simple ones for personal use are included in most smartphones. The main reference standard for contact data and metadata,
						semantic and interchange, is the vCard.
						Sophisticated contact managers provide calendar sharing features and allow colleagues to access
						the same database.

					<p class="text-start">
						The main reference standard is the vCalendar. In management terminology, advanced contact managers can be called individual resource management (IRM) or contact management (CM) tools â€“ systems for managing an individual's interactions with current and
						future contacts, to organize, collaborate, and synchronize health, lifestyle, and financial
						needs.
